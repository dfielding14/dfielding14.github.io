        <h3>Communication Philosophy</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Core promise:</strong> I promise to be open and honest with you, and to listen with the same openness and respect to whatever you want to share with me.</p>
        
        <p>If something isn't working — work quality, pace, or communication — I'll say so directly and respectfully. I won't let concerns sit unspoken.</p>
        
        <p>You don't need to read between the lines. If I haven't raised an issue, you can assume we're fine.</p>
        
        <p>Reach out whenever you need — email or Slack as often as you like with questions, ideas, or updates. If we need to tune the cadence or ask for more prep before a message, I'll tell you.</p>
        
        <p>This goes both ways. If you don't like something I'm doing, if my approach doesn't work for you, if something I or someone else did made you uncomfortable — or you're bored, stuck, or just found something funny — tell me. I'll listen with openness, honesty, and no judgment.</p>
        
        <p>The goal is a safe, clear, trusting working relationship so we can focus on doing good science together.</p>
