    <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
    <p>
        I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/departments/physics.html" target="_blank">Department of Physics at New York University</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        My research focuses on theoretical astrophysics, particularly the physics of magnetized turbulence, cosmic-ray transport, and multiphase gas in and around galaxies. I use a combination of large-scale numerical simulations, analytic modeling, and connections to observations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before joining NYU, I was a professor in the Astronomy Department at Cornell University (2023-2025) and a Flatiron Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/" target="_blank">Center for Computational Astrophysics</a> in the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/" target="_blank">Flatiron Institute</a> (2018-2024). I earned my Ph.D. in Astrophysics from UC Berkeley under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~quataert/" target="_blank">Eliot Quataert</a>.
