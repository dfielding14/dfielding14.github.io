        <h3>Research Opportunities</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>NYU undergraduates:</strong> Research positions are filled for the 2025-26 academic year. I supervise student research as part of several programs: the <a href="https://cas.nyu.edu/undergraduate-research/summer-undergraduate-research-incubator.html" target="_blank">Summer Undergraduate Research Incubator (SURI)</a> (open to students in any year; applications typically due in late winter) and the <a href="https://cas.nyu.edu/undergraduate-research/deans-undergraduate-research-fund.html" target="_blank">Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund (DURF)</a> (provides grants for student projects; deadlines each semester). I also supervise undergraduate senior thesis projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>All:</strong> There are many summer research opportunities in astronomy. For US citizens, the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/reu" target="_blank">NSF-funded REU program list</a> is a great place to start. For non-US citizens, a list of opportunities can be found <a href="https://aas.org/careers/internships-summer-jobs" target="_blank">here</a>. Another option open to both US and non-US students is the Caltech <a href="https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/surf" target="_blank">SURF</a> program. Post-bac opportunities include the <a href="https://cresst2.umd.edu" target="_blank">CRESST II program at NASA GSFC</a> and <a href="https://cfa.harvard.edu/opportunities/graduate-undergraduate-programs/spark" target="_blank">SPARK</a>.
